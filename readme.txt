After opening the login folder in vscode, do:
1. npm install
This will install the necessary packages.
2. in the terminal go to the loginapp folder and do:
npm run json:server
This strts the JSON server.
3. Do:  ng serve 
or 
ng serve --port 7007  (which ever port is free)
4. Open the browser with localhost:4200 (for ng serve)
or 
http://localhost:7007/

and explore the app.

Thank you.
